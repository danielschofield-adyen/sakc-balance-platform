How to make an API call
1. Duplicate "template.js". Add all json data here to be sent to the php file to make a call to the API endpoint
2. Duplicate "template.php". Change the url to whichever endpoint you are sending the request to
3. Get response back to your frontend js and do logic on response

See an example of this by going to [localhost]/apiCallExample.html
